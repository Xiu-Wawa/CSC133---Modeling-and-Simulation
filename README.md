### What is Game of Life?:
Game of Life is a mathematical game that simulates 'colonies' that grow or die based on how crowded or lonely they are and is known for the way it creates a beautiful organic display out of randomness.


### How does it Work?:
This game works by configuring the initial conditions of an infinite two-dimensional plane tiled by adjacent square cells. Each of these square cells is considered either alive or dead, and a few simple rules concerning the life and death of these cells over subsequent generations lead to fascinating complex behavior. These rules are:

* Any cell that is alive with fewer than two neighbors (adjacent square cells that are themselves alive) or more than three neighbors dies
* Any cell that is alive with two or three neighbors lives on to the next generation, i.e., t = n + 1
* Any cell that is dead with precisely three neighbors becomes alive
All other dead cells stay dead
